# Marketing Dataset

> This dataset is strictly for educational use!

## Description

This marketing dataset simulates a short advertising campaign for a theoretical company testing out two variations of advertisement: one with an interactive "display", and one without the interactive "display". It contains advertising budget spent, clicks, impressions, transactions, whether or not the interactive display campaign was running, as well as revenue, click-through-rate, and conversion rate over a 40 day period.

### Usage

```R
url_ <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leontoddjohnson/i590/main/data/marketing/marketing.csv"
marketing <- read_delim(url_, delim = ",")
```

### Format

The `marketing` dataset contains `40` rows (each row reports on a single day from the 40-day campaign) and `8` columns:

- `spend`: amount spent on advertising (independent of "display"), based on pay-per-click.
- `clicks`: number of clicks on the ad.
- `impressions`: number of "views" of the ad. 
  - This is $\geq$ *reach* (the unique number of users who saw the ad that day). So, it is possible that one person contributes multiple impressions in a single day.
- `display`: whether or not the advertisement displayed interactive functionality.
  - `1` for running display (ad variation 1), and `0` for *not* running display (ad variation 0).

- `transactions`: number of transactions (e.g., purchases) that day.
- `revenue`: revenue for the day (in dollars)
- `ctr`: Click Through Rate = clicks / impressions
  - Here, `ctr = round(clicks / impressions, 4) * 100`
- `con_rate`: Conversion rate = number of desired actions (as advertised in the ad) / clicks. 
  - I.e., the proportion of all the user-clicks who took the desired action of the advertisement.
