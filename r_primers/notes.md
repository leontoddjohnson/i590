# R Primers

A few notes on what is contained in this folder:

- This folder contains an R Markdown file for the first six primer tutorials in the [posit Cloud R Primers](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers). Each notebook here contains particular concepts from the original tutorial that I felt were worth calling out.
- **These notebooks are not replacements for the tutorial itself. It is highly recommended that you *go through the full tutorial on your own*.** Maybe you can use these as companion notebooks (which you can continue to edit) as you go through them online.

## Setup

To run the notebooks in this folder, you'll need to set up R as described in the *README.md* file in the root directory of this repository.
